1. use count to predict missing IBD pairs 
2. may have to delete heap or release memory

Parts B and E show 
 power to detect IBD as a function of the underlying size of the true IBD segment.  The average 
 proportion of the segment that is detected is shown on the y-axis. ## no overlap is accounted in the average
