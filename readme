### improvements 
1. no need for variation in building the core, if den = 0.8 (var included)
2. 4370 out of 19760 has variation in extended core =~ 25%
3. clst_size = 2 or 3, be careful !!!
4. heuristic stop ==> save time ???
####################
todo
0. delete *Cluster
1. use count to predict missing IBD pairs 
2. may have to delete heap or release memory

Parts B and E show 
 power to detect IBD as a function of the underlying size of the true IBD segment.  The average 
 proportion of the segment that is detected is shown on the y-axis. ## no overlap is accounted in the average
